        <h2>GIS in Motion</h2>
        <p>
          This company is made up of 4 diverse individuals that cover a broad range of GIS professions,
          after all obtaining an undergraduate degree in Geoinformatics at the university of Pretoria, and soon forming a Geospatial Company afterwards.
          GIS in Motion team aims to formulate solutions based on the effective use of geographical information, and spatial and other data.
          The solutions maximise value for our customers by applying mathematical, and machine learning sciences to the unique spatial information.
        </p>

          I am an ambitious and confident young woman, that is currently completing my final year of a BSc Geoinformatics.
          I have focused on developing communication, time-management, and interpersonal skills through working in groups and collaborations.
          I enjoy problem solving, specifically in the geospatial field. <br>

        <h5>Brett Harzon</h5>
        <p>
          GIS Analyst <br>
          <br>
          I am a dedicated, hard-working student, currently enrolled in my third year of a BSc Geoinformatics and aspiring to study BScHons next year.
          I enjoy investigating spatial relationships and I am passionate about geographic problem solving.
          I have primarily been working on the coding necessary for the website.
          Fun fact: a few years ago I was in a band that travelled to Switzerland to take part in an international show. <br>

        <p>
          GIS Technician <br>
          <br>
          I am an outgoing and optimistic person who believes in the phenomenon that things will always work out at the end.
          As a final BSc Geoinformatics student this project helped me enhance my communication skills and being able to work in a group setting.
          My areas of focus were mainly based on the aesthetics of the project, the compiling of the report and the presentation. 
          One fun fact about me is that I was in a choir that won a regional competition even though I cannot sing to save my life. <br>

        <h5>Keren Benjamin</h5>
        <p>
          GIS Technician <br>
          <br>
          I am currently in my final year at the University of Pretoria, studying BSc Geoinformatics.
          I am enthusiastic about using spatial solutions to solve problems, and hope to do my Honours in BSc Geoinformatics next year.
          Creating an application was a daunting task, but the GIS in Motion team helped streamline the process, as we all worked well together.
          I worked primarily on the coding of the website, along with my colleague Brett.
          Fun fact: I have probably said the phrase "Why isn't this working?' over 100 times throughout the duration of the project.  <br>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The problem identified by the University of Pretoria: The students (and staff) are struggling to navigate through the campus efficiently and effectively,
          in order to arrive at class on time. The students have a limited time of 10 minutes between each class to get to their next lecture.
          Many students have reported that the current maps provided are confusing and take too long to navigate with.
        </p>
        <h5>Previous solution:</h5>
        <p>
          The solution that was being used â†’ a non-interactive map of the Campus, provided by the university. <br>

        </p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <h5>Collection:</h5>
        <p>
          The data collection process entails gathering the raw data necessary for this project.
          The main datasets we will be collecting are as follows, during peak and off peak times: 
          <ul>
            <li>Foot Traffic: The number of people passing through the point on foot</li>
            <li>Bicycles intersecting walkways: The number of people passing through the point on a bicycle or other mode of transportation</li>
            <li>Surveys: Qualitative data, through the use of a multiple choice questionnaire </li>
            <li>Roads/Paths: in order to accurately digitise</li>
            <li>Buildings: in order to accurately digitise</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Struggles:</h5>
        <p>
          We had a limited time period to collect the different data between each point, also,
          it was slightly embarrassing standing and watching people walk past us <br>
          <br> 
          32 points were selected through out the Hatfield Campus 
        </p>
        <h2>Teamwork was essential!</h2>
        <h5>Organisation:</h5>
        <p>
          Data Organization involves cleaning the data and putting it into a suitable format.
          The data collected was then organised into spreadsheets, and shapefiles  and saved in a specified database.
        </p>
        <h5>Visualisation:</h5>
        <p>
          Data visualisation is very essential because this is where the clarification and communication of data
          to a broad audience takes place. We made use of bar charts, pie charts and heat maps to better communicate our findings
          which are related to modes of transportation, human traffic, entrances used, relaxation areas and finally,
          the congested areas in the University of Pretoria, Hatfield campus.
